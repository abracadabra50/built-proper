## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Website with Verification Tag

npm run build
# Deploy via Netlify
```

### 2. Verify Domain in GSC
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Add property: `https://builtproper.com`
3. Choose "HTML tag" verification method
4. Click "Verify" - should auto-verify with our meta tag

### 3. Submit Sitemap

2. Submit: `https://builtproper.com/sitemap.xml`

### 4. Set up Google Analytics Authentication
```bash
# Run the setup script we created
/Users/zishan/mcp-seo-tools/setup_ga_auth.sh

# This will:
# 1. Check for gcloud CLI
# 2. Create OAuth configuration
# 3. Open browser for authentication
# 4. Save credentials locally
```

### 5. Test MCP Connections

## 🔐 Security Notes

- ✅ OAuth Client ID is safe to expose (it's public)
- ⚠️ Never commit Client Secret if you have one
- ✅ Verification code is safe in HTML (it's meant to be public)

## 📊 What We Can Monitor

Once connected, we'll track:

- **Impressions** - How often we appear in search
- **Index Coverage** - Which pages Google has indexed
- **Mobile Usability** - Mobile-specific issues
- **Core Web Vitals** - Performance metrics

## 🚀 Testing Commands

Once MCP is connected:
```
"Show me Built Proper's top search queries"
"What's our average position for 'tradesman websites'?"
"Check indexing status for all location pages"
"Find pages with high impressions but low CTR"
"Show search performance trend for last 30 days"
```
