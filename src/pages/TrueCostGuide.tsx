Here's the truth: Most tradesman website builders are hiding the real costs. They lure you in with low upfront prices, then hit you with monthly fees, add-ons, and limitations that cost you thousands over time.

This guide reveals EVERYTHING - the true costs, hidden fees, and what you're really paying for. No sales pitch, just honest numbers from someone who's built hundreds of trade websites.`

**Reality:** Â£299 setup + Â£39/month hosting + Â£19/month maintenance + Â£29/month for email + Â£49 for SSL certificate + Â£199 for mobile optimization = Â£1,883 in year one alone.

Over 3 years? That "Â£299 website" costs Â£3,603. And that's before any updates, changes, or additional features.`

Most companies force you to use their hosting. You can't move elsewhere. You're locked in forever.

**2. Maintenance Contracts (Â£30-100/month)**
"Required for updates and security" they say. In reality, you're paying for 5 minutes of work monthly.

**3. Change Requests (Â£50-200 each)**
Want to update your phone number? Â£50. Add a new service? Â£150. Change a photo? Â£75. It adds up fast.

**4. Plugin/Extension Fees (Â£10-50/month each)**
Contact forms, galleries, booking systems - each costs extra monthly. A basic site needs 5-10 plugins minimum.

**5. Email Hosting (Â£5-30/month per email)**
Yes, they charge you for email addresses at your own domain. 5 staff emails? That's Â£150/month with some providers.`

**Rated People:** Credit system averaging Â£200-400/month + constant undercutting on price

**3-Year Directory Costs:**
- Checkatrade: Â£3,960
- MyBuilder: Â£10,800 (at Â£300/month average)

**Security Costs:** WordPress sites get hacked constantly. Recovery costs Â£500-2,000 each time.

**Plugin Hell:** Average WordPress site needs 15-20 plugins. Each needs updates, causes conflicts, and many charge monthly fees. Annual plugin costs: Â£500-1,500.

**Performance Issues:** WordPress is slow. You'll spend Â£1,000+ annually on premium hosting, CDNs, and optimization plugins just to achieve decent speed.

**Developer Dependency:** Every change requires a developer. Can't update it yourself despite promises of "easy editing". Annual developer costs: Â£1,000-3,000.

**Obsolescence:** WordPress sites need rebuilding every 3-4 years as themes and plugins become outdated. That's another Â£2,000-5,000.

**Total 5-Year WordPress Cost:** Â£15,000-25,000 when you factor in everything.`

**Step 2: Determine Leads Needed**
- Website cost: Â£3,000
- Customers needed to break even: 3
- With 20% conversion rate: 15 leads needed

**Step 3: Realistic Lead Generation**
- Proper website generates: 5-10 leads/month
- Break-even timeline: 2-3 months
- Annual ROI: 300-500%

**Example:** Plumber spending Â£3,000 on proper website
- Generates 8 leads/month
- Converts 2 into customers
- Average job: Â£600
- Monthly revenue from website: Â£1,200
- ROI in 3 months: Â£3,600
- Annual ROI: Â£14,400 (480% return)`

**Cheap Website (Â£500) Reality:**
- No custom design (looks like everyone else's)
- Poor performance (slow loading, high bounce rate)
- Bad SEO (invisible on Google)
- No conversions (visitors don't become customers)
- Monthly fees (Â£50/month forever)
- Total 3-year cost: Â£2,300
- Leads generated: 1-2/month
- ROI: Negative

**Proper Website (Â£3,000) Reality:**
- Custom design (stands out from competition)
- Fast performance (visitors stay and engage)
- Optimized SEO (rank on page 1)
- High conversions (visitors become customers)
- No monthly fees (you own it)
- Total 3-year cost: Â£3,000
- Leads generated: 8-12/month
- ROI: 400%+

**Tradesmen with cheap/no websites:**
- Dependent on directories (Â£300-500/month)
- Competing on price (race to the bottom)
- No control over their leads
- Working harder for less money
- Business value: Just equipment and van

**Tradesmen with proper websites:**
- Generate their own leads (free after initial investment)
- Compete on quality (better customers)
- Full control of their marketing
- Working smarter for more money
- Business value: Includes digital assets worth Â£10,000+

The question isn't "Can I afford a proper website?"
The question is "Can I afford NOT to have one?"

In 2025, a proper website isn't an expense - it's an investment that pays for itself in 2-3 months and generates returns for years.

Stop renting your online presence. Stop paying monthly fees. Stop competing with everyone else on directories.

Get Built Proper. Own your digital future.`
